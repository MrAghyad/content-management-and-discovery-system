# 🚀 Future Work & Roadmap

This document outlines potential **next steps and enhancements** for the system. These are not immediate requirements but serve as a roadmap for scaling, improving search capabilities, and adopting new technologies.

## Enhanced Discovery with LLMs + Vector Databases

The current Discovery module uses **OpenSearch** for keyword/full-text search.  
To improve **semantic search** and **personalized recommendations**, we plan to integrate **Vector DBs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).**

### Why Vector Search?
- Current search is lexical: “AI podcast” ≠ “Artificial Intelligence podcast”.
- Vector search captures **semantic similarity** using embeddings.
- Supports **multi-modal search** (text, audio transcripts, video captions, metadata).

### Proposed Enhancements
1. **Vector Database Integration**  
   - Evaluate **Weaviate**, **Pinecone**, or **OpenSearch Vector Plugin**.  
   - Store embeddings for content (title, description, transcript).  
   - Query by vector similarity alongside traditional filters (language, category, date).

2. **RAG Pipeline with LLMs**  
   - Embed user queries → retrieve top-N semantically relevant documents from vector DB → feed into LLM → generate enriched results (summaries, highlights, contextual recommendations).
   - Example: *“Find episodes about urban planning in Arabic”* → return episodes that mention urban design, city growth, etc., even if the keyword “urban planning” isn’t present.

3. **Personalized Recommendations**  
   - Fine-tune embeddings with **user preferences** (watch history, categories followed).  
   - Use **hybrid ranking**: combine semantic similarity + popularity + recency.

4. **Content Summarization & Q&A**  
   - On-demand episode summaries powered by LLMs.  
   - User can ask: *“What did the speaker say about climate change in episode 12?”* → RAG retrieves transcript chunks → LLM summarizes.

## Infrastructure & Tooling

- **Observability**: add tracing (OpenTelemetry), metrics (Prometheus + Grafana), structured logging (ELK).
- **CI/CD**: automated builds, linting, testing, and deploys with GitHub Actions.
- **Scalability**: autoscaling for Discovery (index-heavy service) and Celery workers.
